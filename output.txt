The natural of Yawning 
 

   
  
IELTSMATERIAL.COM 56 
 
A.  While  fatigue,  drowsiness  or  boredom  easily  bring  on  yawns,  scientists  are 
discovering there is more to yawning than most people think. Not much is known 
about why we yawn or if it serves any useful function. People have already learned 
that yawning can be infectious. “Contagious yawning” is the increase in likelihood that 
you will yawn after watching or hearing someone else yawn, but not much is known 
about the under-lying causes, and very little research has been done on the subject. 
However, scientists at the University of Albany, as well as the University of Leeds and 
the University of London have done some exploration. 
 
B. It is commonly believed that people yawn as a result of being sleepy or tired because 
they need oxygen. However, the latest research shows that a yawn can help cool the 
brain and help it work more effectively, which is quite different from the popular belief 
that yawning promotes sleep and is a sign of tiredness. Dr. Andrew Gallup and his 
colleagues at the University of Albany in New York State said their experiments on 44 
students showed that raising or lowering oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the blood 
did not produce that reaction. In the study participants were shown videos of people 
laughing  and  yawning,  and  researchers  counted  how  many  times  the  volunteers 
responded to the “contagious yawns”. The researchers found that those who breathed 
through the nose rather than the mouth were less likely to yawn when watching a 
video of other people yawning. The same effect was found among those who held a 
cool pack to their forehead, whereas those who held a warm pack yawned while 
watching the video. Since yawning occurs when brain temperature rises, sending cool 
blood to the brain serves to maintain the best levels of mental efficiency. 
 
C. Yawning is universal to humans and many animals. Cats, dogs and fish yawn just like 
humans do, but they yawn spontaneously. Only humans and chimpanzees, our closest 
relatives in the animal kingdom, have shown definite contagious yawning. Though 
much of yawning is due to suggestibility, sometimes people do not need to actually 
see a person yawn to involuntarily yawn themselves: hearing someone yawning or 
even reading about yawning can cause the same reaction. 
 
D. However, contagious  yawning  goes beyond  mere suggestibility.  Recent studies 
show that contagious yawning is also related to our predisposition toward empathy— 
the ability to understand and connect with others’ emotional states. So empathy is 
important, sure, but how could it possibly be related to contagious yawning? Leave it 
up to psychologists at Leeds University in England to answer that. In their study, 
researchers selected 40 psychology students and 40 engineering students. Generally, 

   
  
IELTSMATERIAL.COM 57 
 
psychology students are more likely to feel empathy for others, while engineering 
students are thought to be concerned with objects and science. Each student was 
made to wait individually in a waiting room, along with an undercover assistant who 
yawned  10  times  in  as  many  minutes.  The  students  were  then  administered  an 
emotional quotient test: students were shown 40 images of eyes and asked what 
emotion each one displayed. The results of the test support the idea that contagious 
yawning is linked to empathy. The psychology students—whose future profession 
requires them to focus on others—yawned contagiously an average of 5.5 times in the 
waiting  room  and  scored  28  out  of  40  on  the  emotional  test.  The  engineering 
students—who tend to focus on things like numbers and systems—yawned an average 
of 1.5 times and scored 25.5 out of 40 on the subsequent test. The difference doesn’t 
sound like much, but researchers consider it significant. Strangely enough, women, 
who are generally considered more emotionally attuned, didn’t score any higher than 
men.    
 
E. Another study, led by Atsushi Senju, a cognitive researcher at the University of 
London,  also  sought  to  answer  that  question.  People  with  autism  disorder  are 
considered  to  be  developmentally  impaired  emotionally.  Autistics  have  trouble 
connecting  with  others  and  find  it  difficult  to  feel  empathy.  Since  autistics  have 
difficulty feeling empathy, then they shouldn’t be susceptible to contagious yawning. 
To find out, Senju and his colleagues placed 49 kids aged 7 to 15 in a room with a 
television. 24 of the test subjects had been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, 
the other 25 were non-autistic kids. The test subjects were shown short clips of people 
yawning as well as clips of people opening their mouths but not yawning. While the 
kids with autism had the same lack of reaction to both kinds of clips, the non-autistic 
kids yawned more after the clips of people yawning. 
 
F.  There  also  have  been  studies  that  suggest  yawning,  especially  psychological 
“contagious” yawning, may have developed as a way of keeping a group of animals 
alert and bonding members of a group into a more unit one. If an animal is drowsy or 
bored, it may not be as alert as it should to be prepared to spring into action and its 
yawning is practically saying, “Hey, I need some rest, you stay awake”. Therefore, a 
contagious yawn could be an instinctual reaction to a signal from one member of the 
herd reminding the others to stay alert when danger comes. So the theory suggests 
evidence that yawning comes from the evolution of early humans to be ready to 
physically exert themselves at any given moment.

WATER TREATMENT 2 : REED BEB 
 
In recent years, it has been shown that plants, more accurately roots, play a crucial 
part in purifying dirty water before it enters seas and rivers. In 15th-century Britain, 
dirty water was purified by passing through the wetlands. People began to realize that 
the  “natural”  way  of  water  purification  was  effective. Nowadays subsurface flow 
wetlands (SSFW) are a common alternative in Europe for the treatment of wastewater 
in rural areas, Mainly in the last 10 to 12 years there has been a significant growth in 
the number and size of the systems in use. The conventional mechanism of water 
purification used in big cities where there are large volumes of water to be purified is 
inappropriate in rural areas. 
 
The common reed has the ability to transfer oxygen from its leaves, down through its 
stem and rhizomes, and out via its root system. As a result of this action, a very high 
population of microorganisms occurs in the root system, in zones of aerobic, anoxic, 
and anaerobic conditions. As the waste water moves very slowly through the mass of 
reed roots, this liquid can be successfully treated. The reason why they are so effective 
is often because within the bed’s root sector, natural biological, physical and chemical 
processes interact with one another to degrade or remove a good range of pollutants. 
 
Dirty water from households, farms and factories consume a lot of oxygen in the 
water, which will lead to the death of aquatic creatures. Several aquatic plants are 

   
  
IELTSMATERIAL.COM 60 
 
important in purifying water. They not only absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen 
into the water, improving the environment for fish, but absorb nutrients from the 
welter as well. Britain and the G.S. differ in their preference of plants to purify water. 
Bulrushes (Scirpus spp.) and rushes (Juncus spp.) are excellent water purifiers. They 
remove excess nutrients from the water as well as oil and bacteria such as Escherichia 
coli and Salmonella. However, algae grow freely in summer and die off in winter. Their 
remains foul the bottom of the pool. 
 
Artificial reed beds purify water in both horizontal and downflow ways. The reeds 
succeed best when a dense layer of root hairs has formed. It takes three years for the 
roots to fully develop. Which type of wetland a certain country applies varies widely 
depending on the country in Europe and its main lines of development. Besides the 
development of horizontal or vertical flow wetlands for wastewater treatment, the 
use of wetlands for sludge treatment has been very successful in Europe. Some special 
design lines offer the retention of microbiological organisms in constructed wetlands, 
the treatment of agricultural wastewater, treatment of some kinds of industrial waste-
water, and the control of diffuse pollution. 
 
If the water is slightly polluted, a horizontal system is used. Horizontal-flow wetlands 
may be of two types: free-water surface-flow (FWF) or sub-surface water-flow (SSF). 
In the former the effluent flows freely above the sand/gravel bed in which the reeds 
etc. are planted; in the latter effluent passes through the sand/gravel bed. In FWF-type 
wetlands, effluent is treated by plant stems, leaves and rhizomes. Such FWF wetlands 
are densely planted and typically have water-depths of less than 0.4m. However, 
dense planting can limit the diffusion of oxygen into the water. These systems work 
particularly well for low strength effluents or effluents that have undergone some 
forms of pretreatment and  play an invaluable role  in tertiary  treatment and the 
polishing of effluents. The horizontal reed flow system uses a long reed bed, where 
the liquid slowly flows horizontally through. The length of the reed bed is about 100 
meters. The downside of horizontal reed beds is that they use up lots of land space 
and they do take quite a long time to produce clean water. 
 
A vertical flow (downflow) reed bed is a sealed, gravel filled trench with reeds growing 
in it. The reeds in a downflow system are planted in a bed 60cm deep. In vertical flow 
reed beds, the wastewater is applied to the top of the reed bed, flows down through 
a rhizome zone with sludge as a substrate, then through a root zone with sand as a 
substrate, followed by a layer of gravel for drainage, and is collected in an under 

   
  
IELTSMATERIAL.COM 61 
 
drainage system of large stones. The effluent flows onto the surface of the bed and 
percolates slowly through the different layers into an outlet pipe, which leads to a 
horizontal  flow  bed  where  it  is  cleaned  by  millions  of  bacteria,  algae,  fungi,  and 
microorganisms that digest the waste, including sewage. There is no standing water 
so there should be no unpleasant smells. 
 
Vertical flow reed bed systems are much more effective than horizontal flow reed-
beds not only in reducing biochemical oxygen demanded (BOD) and suspended solids 
(SS)  levels  but  also  in  reducing  ammonia  levels  and  eliminating  smells.  Usually 
considerably smaller than horizontal flow beds, they are capable of handling much 
stronger effluents which contain heavily polluted matters and have a longer lifetime 
value. A vertical reed bed system works more efficiently than a horizontal reed bed 
system, but it requires more management, and its reed beds are often operated for a 
few days then rested, so several beds and a distribution system are needed. 
 
The natural way of water purification has many advantages over the conventional 
mechanism. The natural way requires less expenditure for installation, operation and 
maintenance. Besides, it looks attractive and can improve the surrounding landscape. 
Reed beds are natural habitats found in floodplains, waterlogged depressions and 
estuaries.  The natural bed systems are a  biologically  proved, an environmentally 
friendly and visually unobtrusive way of treating wastewater, and have the extra virtue 
of frequently being better than mechanical wastewater treatment systems. Over the 
medium to long term reed bed systems are, in most cases, more cost effective to install 
than  any  other  wastewater  treatment.  They  are  naturally  environmentally  sound 
protecting groundwater, dams, creeks, rivers and estuaries.

History of telegraph in communication 
 
Jean  -Antoine Nollet was a French clergyman and physicist. In 1746 he gathered about 
two hundred monks into a circle about a mile (1.6 km) in circumference, with pieces 
iron wire connecting them. He then discharged a battery of Leyden jars through the 
human chain and observed that each man reacted at substantially the same time to 
the electric shock, showing that the speed of electricity's propagation was very high. 
Given a more humane detection system, this could be a way of signaling over long 
distances. In 1 748, Nollet invented one of the first electrometers, the electroscope, 
which detected the presence of an electric charge by using electrostatic attraction and 
repulsion. 
 

   
  
IELTSMATERIAL.COM 64 
 
After the introduction of the European semaphore lines in 1792, the world's desire to 
further its ability to communicate from a distance only grew. People wanted a way to 
send and receive news from remote locations so that they could better understand 
what was happening in the world around them—not just what was going on in their 
immediate town or city. This type of communication not only appealed to the media 
industry, but also to private individuals and companies who wished to stay in touch 
with contacts. In 1840 Charles Wheatstone from Britain, with William Cooke, obtained 
a new patent for a telegraphic arrangement. The new apparatus required only a single 
pair of wires, but the telegraph was still too costly for general purposes. In 1 845, 
however, Cooke and Wheatstone succeeded in producing the single needle apparatus, 
which they patented,and from that time the electric telegraph became a practical 
instrument, soon adopted on all the railway lines of the country. 
 
It was the European optical telegraph, or semaphore, that was the predecessor of the 
electrical recording telegraph that changed the history of communication forever. 
Building on the success of the optical telegraph, Samuel F. B. Morse completed a 
worki   ng version of the electrical recording telegraph, which only required a single wire 
to send code of dots and dashes. At first, it was imagined that only a few highly skilled 
encoders would be able to use it but it soon became clear that many people could 
become proficient in Morse code. A system of lines strung on telegraph poles began 
to spread in Europe and America. 
 
In the 1840s and 1850s several individuals proposed or advocated construction of a 
telegraph cable across the Atlantic Ocean, including Edward Thornton and Alonzo 
Jackman. At that time there was no material available for cable insulation and the first 
breakthrough came with the discovery of a rubber-like latex called  gutta percha. 
Introduced to Britain in 1843, gutta percha is the gum of a tree native to the Malay 
Peninsula  and  Malaysia.  After  the  failure  of  their  first  cable  in  1850,  the  British 
brothers John and Jacob Brett laid a successful submarine cable from Dover to Calais 
in 1851. This used two layers of gutta percha insulation and an armoured outer layer. 
With thin wire and thick insulation, it floated and had to be weighed down with lead 
pipe.    
 
In the case of first submarine-cable telegraphy, there was the limitation of knowledge 
of how its electrical properties were affected by water. The voltage which may be 
impressed on the cable was limited to a definite value. Moreover, for certain reasons, 
the cable had an impedance associated with it at the sending end which could make 

   
  
IELTSMATERIAL.COM 65 
 
the voltage on the cable differ from the voltage applied to the sending-end apparatus. 
In fact, the cable was too big for a single boat, so two had to start in the middle of the 
Atlantic, join their cables and sail in opposite directions. Amazingly, the first official 
telegram to pass between two continents was a letter of congratulation from Queen 
Victoria of the United Kingdom to the President of the United States, James Buchanan, 
on August 16, 1 858. However, signal quality declined rapidly, slowing transmission to 
an almost unusable speed and the cable was destroyed the following month. 
 
To complete the link between England and Australia, John Pender formed the British-
Australian  Telegraph  Company.  The  first  stage  was  to  lay  a  557nm  cable  from 
Singapore to Batavia on the island of Java in 1870. It seemed likely that it would come 
ashore qt the northern port of Darwin from where it might connect around the coast 
to Queensland and New South Wales. It was an undertaking more ambitious than 
spanning ocean. Flocks of sheep had to be driven with the 400 workers to provide 
food. They needed horses and bullock carts and, for the parched interior, camels. In 
the north, tropical rains left the teams flooded. In the centre, it seemed that they 
would die of thirst. One critical section in the red heart of Australia involved finding a 
route through the McDonnell mountain range and then finding water on the other 
side. The water was not only essential for the construction teams. There had to be 
telegraph repeater stations every few hundred miles to boost the signal and the staff 
obviously had to have a supply of water. 
 
On August 22, 1872, the Northern and Southern sections of the Overland Telegraph 
Line were connected, uniting the Australian continent and within a few months, 
Australia was at last in direct contact with England via the submarine cable, too. This 
allowed the Australian Government to receive news from around the world almost 
instantaneously for the first time. It could cost several pounds to send a message and 
it might take several hours for it to reach its destination on the other side of the globe, 
but the world would never be the same again. The telegraph was the first form of 
communication over a great distance and was a landmark in human history.

READING PASSAGE 1  
 
The Mozart Effect 
A. Music has been used for centuries to heal the body. 
In  the Ebers  Papyrs (one  of  the  earliest  medical 
documents,  circa  1500  B.C.),  it  was  recorded  that 
physicians chanted to heal the sick (Castleman, 1994). In 
various cultures, we have observed singing as part of 
healing  rituals.  In  the  world  of  Western  medicine, 
however, using music in medicine lost popularity until 
the introduction of the radio. Researchers then started 
to  notice  that  listening  to  music  could  have  significant  physical 
effects. Therapists noticed music could help calm anxiety and researchers saw 
that listening to music could cause a drop in blood pressure. In addition to these 
two areas, music has been used with cancer chemotherapy to reduce nausea, 
during   surgery to reduce stress hormone production, during childbirth, and in 
stroke recovery (Castleman, 1994 and Westley, 1998). It has been shown to 
decrease pain as well as enhance the effectiveness of the immune system. In 
Japan, compilations of music are used as medication, of sorts. For example, if 
you want to cure a headache or migraine, the album suggested Mendelssohn's 
"Spring  Song,"  Dvorak's "Humoresque,"  or  part  of  George  Gershwin's  "An 
American  in  Paris"  (Campbell, 1998).  Music  is  also  being  used  to  assist  in 
learning, in a phenomenon called the Mozart Effect. 
B.  Frances  H.  Rauscher,  Ph.D.,  first  demonstrated  the 
correlation between music and learning in an experiment 
in 1993. His experiments indicated that a 10 minute dose 
of Mozart could temporarily boost intelligence. Groups of 
students were given intelligence tests after listening to 
silence,  relaxation  tapes,  or  Mozart's  Sonata  for  Two 
Pianos in D Major for a short time. He found that after 
silence,  the  average  IQ  score  was  110,  and  after  the 
relaxation  tape,  scores  rose  a  point.  After  listening  to 
Mozart, however, the scores jumped to 119 (Westley, 1998). Even students who 
did not like the music still had an increased score on the IQ test. Rauscher 
hypothesized that "listening to complex, non-repetitive music, like Mozart, may 
simulate neural pathways that are important in thinking" (Castleman, 1994). 

   
  
IELTSMATERIAL.COM 173 
 
C. The same experiment was repeated on rats by Rauscher and Hong Hua Li from 
Stanford.  Rats  also  demonstrated  enhancement  in  their  intelligence 
performance. These new studies indicate that rats that were exposed to Mozart 
showed "increased gene expression of BDNF (a neural growth factor), CREB (a 
learning and memory compound), and Synapsin I(a synaptic growth protein)" in 
the brain's hippocampus, compared with rats in the control group, which heard 
only white noise (e.g. the whooshing sound of a radio tuned between stations) 
D. How exactly does the Mozart affect work? Researchers are still trying to 
determine the actual mechanisms for the formation of these enhanced learning 
pathways.  Neuroscientists  suspect  that  music  can  actually  help  build  and 
strengthen  connections  between  neurons  in  the 
cerebral cortex in a process similar to what occurs in 
brain  development  despite  its  type.  When  a  baby  is 
born, certain connections have already been made -  like 
connections  for  heartbeat  and  breathing.  As  new 
information is  learned and motor skills  develop, new 
neural connections are formed. Neurons that are not 
used  will  eventually  die  while  those  used  repeatedly  will  form strong 
connections.  Although  a  large  number  of  these  neural  connections  require 
experience, they also must occur within a certain time frame. For example, a 
child born with cataracts cannot develop connections within the visual cortex. If 
the cataracts are removed by surgery right away, the child's vision develops 
normally. However, after the age of 2, if the cataracts are removed, the child will 
remain blind because those pathways cannot establish themselves. 
E. Music seems to work in the same way. In October of 1997, researchers at the 
University  of  Konstanz  in  Germany  found  that  music  actually  rewires 
neural     circuits (Begley, 1996). Although some of these circuits are formed for 
physical skills needed to play an instrument, just listening to music strengthens 
connection used in higher-order thinking. Listening to music can then be thought 
of as   "exercise" for the brain, improving concentration and enhancing intuition. 

   
  
IELTSMATERIAL.COM 174 
 
F. If you're a little skeptical about the claims made by supporters of the Mozart 
Effec  t,  you're  not  alone.  Many  people  accredit  the 
advanced  learning  of  some  children  who take  music 
lessons to other personality traits, such as motivation 
and  persistence, which  is  required  in  all  types  of 
learning.   There   have   also   been   claims   of 
that    influencing the results of some experiments. 
G. Furthermore, many people are critical of the role the 
media  had  in  turning  an  isolated  study  into  a  trend  for  parents  and  music 
educators. After Mozart Effect was published to the public, the sales of Mozart 
CDs stayed on the top of the hit list for three weeks. In an article by Michael 
Linton, he wrote that the research that began this phenomenon (the study by 
researchers at the University of California Irvine) showed only a temporary boost 
in IQ, which was not significant enough to even last throughout the course of the 
experiment.  Using  music  to  influence intelligence  was  used  in  Confucian 
civilization and Plato alluded to Pythagorean music when he described is ideal 
state in The Republic. In both of these examples, music did not have caused any 
overwhelming changes, and the theory eventually died out. Linton also asks, "If 
Mozart's  Music  were  able  to improve  health,  why  was  Mozart  himself  so 
frequently  sick?  If  listening  to  Mozart's music  increases  intelligence  and 
encourages  spirituality,  why  aren't  the  world's smartest  and  most  spiritual 
people Mozart specialists?"  Linton raises an interesting point,  if  the Mozart 
Effect  causes  such  significant  changes,  why  isn't  there  more documented 
evidence? 
H. The "trendiness" of the Mozart Effect may have died out somewhat, but there 
are still strong supporters (and opponents) of the claims made in 1993. Since 
that  initial experiment,  there  has  not  been  a  surge  of supporting  evidence. 
However, many parents, after playing classical music while pregnant or when 
theft children are young, will swear by the Mozart Effect. A classmate of mine 
once  told  me  that  listening  to classical  music  while  studying  will  help  with 
memorization. If we approach this controversy from a scientific aspect, although 
there  has  been  some  evidence  that  music  does  increase  brain  activity, 
actual    improvements  in  learning  and  memory  have  not  been  adequately 
demonstrated.

London Swaying Footbridge 
A. In September 1996 a competition was organized by the Financial Times in 
association  with  the  London  Borough  of  Southwark  to  design  a  new 
footbridge across the Thames. The competition attracted over 200 entries and 
was won by a team comprising Arup (engineers), Foster and Partners (architects) 
and the sculptor Sir Anthony Caro. 
B. The bridge opened to the public on 10 June 2000. Up 
to 100,000 people crossed it that day with up to 2000 
people on the bridge at any one time. At first, the bridge 
was still. Then it began to 
sway  just  slightly.  Then, 
almost from one moment 
to  the  next,  when  large 
groups  of  people  were  crossing,  the  wobble 
intensified.  This  movement  became  sufficiently 
large  for  people  to  stop  walking  to  retain  their 
balance and sometimes to hold onto the hand rails 
for support. It was decided immediately to limit the number of people on the 
bridge, but even so the deck movement was sufficient to be uncomfortable and 
to raise concern for public safety so that on 12 June the bridge was closed until 
the problem could be solved. 
C. The embarrassed engineers found the videotape that day which showed the 
center span swaying about 3 inches side to side every second. The engineers first 

   
  
IELTSMATERIAL.COM 177 
 
thought that winds might be exerting excessive force on    the many large flags and 
banners bedecking the bridge for its gala premiere. What’s more, they also 
discovered that the pedestrians also played a key role. Human activities, such as 
walking, running, jumping, swaying, etc. could cause horizontal force which in 
turn  could  cause  excessive  dynamic  vibration  in  the  lateral  direction  in  the 
bridge. As the structure began moving, pedestrians adjusted their gait to the 
same lateral rhythm as the bridge. The adjusted footsteps magnified the motion 
-  just lik   e when four people all stand up in a small boat at the same time. As more 
pedestrians locked into the same rhythm, the increasing oscillations led to the 
dramatic swaying captured on film. 
D. In  order  to  design  a  method  of  reducing  the 
movements, the force exerted by the pedestrians had 
to  be  quantified  and  related  to the  motion  of  the 
bridge. Although there are some descriptions of this 
phenomenon  in existing  literature,  none  of  these 
actually quantifies  the  force.  So  there  was 
no quantitative  analytical way  to  design  the bridge 
against  this  effect.  An  immediate research  program 
was launched by the bridge's engineering  designers 
Ove Arup, supported by a number of universities and research organizations. 
E. The tests at the University of Southampton involved a person walking ‘on the 
spot’ on a small shake table. The tests at Imperial College involved persons 
walking  along  a  specially  built,  7.2m-long  platform which  could  be  driven 
laterally at different frequencies (n and amplitudes. Each type of test had its 
limitations. The Imperial College tests were only able to capture 7-8 footsteps, 
and the ‘walking on the spot’ tests, although monitoring many footsteps, could 
not  investigate  normal forward  walking. Neither  test  could  investigate  any 
influence of other people in a crowd on the behavior of the individual being 
tested. 
F. The results of the laboratory tests provided information which enabled the 
initial design of a retro-  fit to be progressed. However, the limitations of these 
tests was clear and it was felt that the only way to replicate properly the precise 
conditions of the Millennium Bridge was to carry out crowd tests on the bridge 
deck itself. These tests done by the Arup engineers could incorporate factors not 
possible in the laboratory tests. The first of these was carried out with 100 
people in July 2000. The results of these tests were used to refine the load model 
for the pedestrians. A second series of crowd tests was carried out on the bridge 

   
  
IELTSMATERIAL.COM 178 
 
in December 2000. The purpose of these tests was to further validate the design 
assumptions and to load test a prototype damper installation. The  test was 
carried out with 275 people. 
G. Unless the usage of the bridge was to be greatly restricted, only two generic 
options to improve its performance were considered feasible. The first was 
to increase the stiffness of the bridge to move all its lateral natural frequencies 
out   of the range that could be excited by the lateral footfall forces, and the 
second was  to  increase  the  damping  of  the  bridge  to  reduce  the  resonant 
response.

Book review on Musiccophilia 
Norman M. Weinberger reviews the latest work of Oliver 
Sacks 
A.  Music  and  the  brain  are  both  endlessly  fascinating 
subjects, and as a neuroscientist specialising in auditory 
learning and memory, I find them especially intriguing. So I 
had high expectations of Musicophilia, the latest offering 
from neurologist and prolific author Oliver Sacks. And I confess to feeling a little 
guilty reporting that my reactions to the book are mixed. 

   
  
IELTSMATERIAL.COM 180 
 
B. Sacks himself  is  the best part of Musicophilia. He  richly 
documents his own life in the book and reveals highly personal 
experiences. The photograph of him on the cover of the book-
which  shows  him  wearing headphones,  eyes  closed,  clearly 
enchanted as he listens to Alfred Brendel perform Beethoven’s 
Pathetique Sonata-makes a positive impression that is home 
out by the contents of the book. Sacks’s voice throughout is 
steady  and  erudite  but  never  pontifical.  He  is  neither  self-
conscious nor self-promoting. 
C. The preface gives a good idea of what the book will deliver. In it Sacks explains 
that  he  wants  to  convey  the  insights  gleaned  from  the  “enormous  and 
rapidly growing body of work on the neural underpinnings of musical perception 
and   imagery, and the complex and often bizarre disorders to which these are 
prone.” He also stresses the importance of “the simple art of observation” and 
“the   richness of the human context.” He wants to combine “observation and 
description with the latest in technology,” he says, and to imaginatively enter 
into the experience of his patients and subjects. The reader can see that Sacks, 
who has been practicing neurology for 40 years, is tom 
between the ‘ old-fashioned path o  observation and the 
new  fangled,  high-tech  approach:  He  knows  that  he 
needs to take heed of the latter, but his heart lies with 
the former. 
D. The book consists mainly of detailed descriptions of 
cases, most of them involving patients whom Sacks has 
see n in his practice. Brief discussions of contemporary neuroscientific reports 
are sprinkled liberally throughout the text. Part, “Haunted by Music,” begins 
with the strange case of Tony Cicoria, a nonmusical, middle-aged surgeon who 
was consumed by a love of music after being hit by lightning. He suddenly began 
to crave listening to piano music, which he had never cared for in the past. He 
started to play the piano and then to compose music, which arose spontaneously 
in his mind in a “torrent” of notes. How could this happen? Was the cause 
psychological? (He had had a near-death experience when the lightning struck 
him.) Or was it the direct result of a change in the auditory regions of his cerebral 
cortex? Electroencephalography (EEG) showed his brain waves to be normal in 
the  mid  -1990s, just after his, trauma and subsequent “conversion” to music. 
There are now more sensitive tests, but Cicoria, has declined to undergo them; 
he does not want to delve into the causes of his musicality. What a shame! 

   
  
IELTSMATERIAL.COM 181 
 
E.  Part  II,  “A  Range  of  Musicality,”  covers  a  wider  variety  of  topics,  but 
unfortunately, some of the chapters offer little or nothing that  is new. For 
example, chapter 13, which is five pages long, merely notes that the blind often 
have better hearing than the sighted. The most interesting chapters are those 
that present the strangest cases. Chapter 8 is about “amusia,” an inability to hear 
sounds as music, and “dysharmonia,” a highly specific impairment of the ability 
to hear harmony, with the ability to understand melody left intact. Such specific 
“dissociations” are found throughout the cases Sacks recounts. 
F. To Sacks’s credit, part III, “Memory, Movement and Music,” brings US into the 
underappreciated  realm  of  music  therapy.  Chapter  16  explains  how 
“melodic int onation therapy” is being used to help expressive aphasic patients 
(those unable to express their  thoughts  verbally following a stroke or other 
cerebral incident) once again become capable of fluent speech. In chapter 20, 
Sacks demonstrates the near  -miraculous power of music to animate Parkinson’s 
patients and other people with severe movement disorders, even those who are 
frozen into odd postures. Scientists cannot yet explain how music achieves this 
effect    
G.  To  readers  who  are  unfamiliar  with  neuroscience  and  music  behavior, 
Musicophilia may be something of a revelation. But the book will not satisfy 
those    seeking the causes and implications of the phenomena Sacks describes. 
For  one thing,  Sacks  appears  to  be  more  at  ease  discussing  patients  than 
discussing experiments.  And  he  tends  to  be  rather  uncritical  in  accepting 
scientific findings and theories. 
H. It’s true that the causes of music-brain oddities remain poorly understood. 
However, Sacks could have done more to draw out some of the implications of 
the  careful  observations  that  he  and  other  neurologists  have  made  and  of 
the  treatments that have been successful. For example, he might have noted 
that  the many  specific  dissociations  among  components  of  music 
comprehension, such as loss of the ability to perceive harmony but not melody, 
indicate  that  there  is  no music  center  in  the  brain. 
Because many people who read the book are likely 
to believe  in  the  brain  localisation  of  all  mental 
functions, this was a missed educational opportunity. 
I.  Another  conclusion  one  could  draw  is  that  there 
seem   to   be   no   “cures”   for   neurological 
problems involving  music.  A  drug  can  alleviate  a 
symptom in one patient and aggravate it in another, or 

   
  
IELTSMATERIAL.COM 182 
 
can have both positive and negative effects in the same patient. Treatments 
mentioned  seem  to  be  almost exclusively  antiepileptic  medications,  which 
“damp down” the excitability of the brain in general; their effectiveness varies 
widely. 
J. Finally, in many of the cases described here the patient with music-brain 
symptoms  is  reported  to  have  “normal”  EEG  results.  Although  Sacks 
recognises the existence of new technologies, among them far more sensitive 
ways to analyze brain waves than the standard neurological EEG test, he does 
not call for their use. In fact, although he exhibits the greatest compassion for 
patients, he conveys no sense of urgency about the pursuit of new avenues in 
the diagnosis and treatment of music-brain disorders. This absence echoes the 
book’s preface, in which Sacks expresses fear that “the simple art of observation 
may be lost” if we rely too much on new technologies. He does call for both 
approaches, though, and we can only hope that the neurological community will 
respond.
